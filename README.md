# mush:room - DIY ultralight open headphones


## Overview

This project is about DIY 3D-printable headphones wich are designed to be used in combination with signal processing, either with binaural convolution or just a simple eq. 
The Design is kept very simple and requires only 5 (+2) printed parts in total. As a headphone driver, the well known HPD-50N25PR00-32 by Peerless was chosen.
Since they are acoustically very transparent, they are not only nice open back headphones but also perfectly suited for AR applications. 
If Bass reproduction is more important than transparency, felt pads, acting like additional masses, can be put in front of the driver.

This repository relates to the free-acces paper "Ultralight circumaural open headphone", which was presented at the Audio Engineering Society Converence in May 2023 in Espoo, Finnland.
The paper is available at https://www.researchgate.net/publication/371379200_Ultralight_circumaural_open_headphones
The development process and measurements are well documented.

Plans and instructions to build them on your own are found below or will be added soon.

## Background

The main idea of this project was what headphones could look like, if the benefits of equalization were considered in the development process?. In addition, since the work was intended to be a freely accessible DIY project, 3D printing was chosen as the manufacturing method to ensure feasibility and repairability.
The resulted hardware design goals emerged as: sufficiently strong reproduction capabilities at low frequencies, resilience to additional boost for subsequent equalization, absence of acoustic reflections and resonances influence the frequency response.

The resulting headphones, whose structure is based on bionic design, are ultralight, circumaural, and acoustically transparent, making them perfect for use in AR, but also for other applications. 


## Features

- 3D printable design
- Optimized for mixed and virtual reality
- Also great for listening to music
- Convertable for different needs (hear-through vs bass reproduction capabilities)

## Getting Started

To get started with building these headphones, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the design files in your preferred 3D printing software.
3. Print the design using a 3D printer.
4. Follow the assembly instructions provided in the repository to put the headphones together. (to come, if not yet available)
