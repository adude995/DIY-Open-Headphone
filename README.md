# DIY Headphone Project

## Overview

This project provides plans and instructions for building diy headphones. The design is optimized for use with virtual and mixed reality, but works also great for normal listening to music. The headphones are 3D printable and therefore easy to build.

## Background

This repository relates to the AES paper "ultralight circumaural open headphones", which documents the development and evaluation of acoustically transparent headphones.
The main research question was "What could headphones look like if the benefits of equalization were considered in the development process?". In addition, since the work was intended to be a freely accessible DIY project, 3D printing was chosen as the manufacturing method to ensure feasibility and repairability.
The resulted hardware design goals emerged as: sufficiently strong reproduction capabilities at low frequencies, resilience to additional boost for subsequent equalization, absence of acoustic reflections and resonances influence the frequency response.

The resulting headphones, whose structure is based on bionic design, are ultralight, circumaural, and acoustically transparent, making them perfect for use in AR, but also for other applications. 


## Features

- 3D printable design
- Optimized for virtual and mixed reality
- Great for listening to music
- Convertable for different needs (hear-through vs bass reproduction capabilities)

## Getting Started

To get started with building these headphones, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the design files in your preferred 3D printing software.
3. Print the design using a 3D printer.
4. Follow the assembly instructions provided in the repository to put the headphones together. (to come, if not yet available)
